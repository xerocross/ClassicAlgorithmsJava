This project contains implementations of various classic algorithms.  The
purpose is mainly practice and just to demonstrate my programming knowledge
and style.  Much of the code here is notably influenced by the book 
Clean Code, and you will often find my implementations very verbose.  
My primary goal throughout has been to write code that can be understood 
by humans, so that I and anyone else can actually understand what
all these algorithms are doing and so that bugs have no place to hide.  In
particular, while I have attempted to avoid needless inefficiency, I have 
not chosen speed optimization in cases where that would make the code more
difficult to read.
